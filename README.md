# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Rate Prediction 


## Introduction
The growth of online hotel booking channels has increased cancellations and no-shows, which negatively affect hotel revenue. Hotels have implemented strategies like deposits and fees, but they can negatively impact the customer experience. To address this, a machine learning solution is proposed, treating it as a binary classification problem to predict cancellations. With this approach, hotels can proactively identify reservations at risk of cancellation and take targeted measures to reduce cancellations while still maintaining a satisfactory customer experience, which can improve revenue management strategies and occupancy rates.
